# ANTIGRAVITY Portfolio

A high-end, immersive portfolio website featuring smooth scrolling, GSAP animations, and unique interactions.

## How to Run

1. **Recommended**: Open this folder in VS Code and use the "Live Server" extension to launch `index.html`. This ensures all scripts and assets load correctly.
2. **Alternative**: Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser. (Note: Some browsers may restrict strict GSAP features on local file protocols, so a server is better).

## Features

- **Smooth Scrolling**: Powered by Lenis for a buttery smooth experience.
- **Cinematic Intro**: Custom loader sequence.
- **Interactive Cursor**: Custom magnetic cursor with blend modes.
- **Horizontal Scroll**: "Work" section scrolls horizontally while pinned.
- **Dynamic Themes**: Background colors shift as you scroll through sections.
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes.

## Customization

- **Images**: Replace the CSS gradients in `.p1`, `.p2`, etc., with `background-image: url(...)` to use real project screenshots.
- **Text**: Edit `index.html` to update your content.
- **Colors**: Modify the `:root` variables in `style.css`.
